# Altamont-Hacktoberfest-HTML-2019

Welcome to the Altamont Hacktoberfest for HTML and CSS. If you are a student at Altamont, feel free to contribute to the repo.
The instructions for this repo are to create a link in the Nav for your information (look for the comments). Then direct that link to a card that you create. In the card, you can put what you want to put in it. Feel free to add external links, pictures, etc. Anything that's not appropriate will not be approved for your PR. Feel free to add on the site as you see fit.

Happy coding!
